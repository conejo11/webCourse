  <h1>ACT</h1>
  <p>I don't know why this class is so bad! I can list everything that pisses me off in it:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The professor digresses ALL THE TIME.</li>
    <li>The subject is not interesting at all.</li>
    <li>The professor don't give us the class slides.</li>
    <li>We don't have enough material to study.</li>
    <li>Can't remember now, but the fact that i'm doing this in class just to stay awake is a good reason.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>A table just to train a little bit:</p>

  <table border="1">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>ACT</th>
        <th>CGR</th>
        <th>POO</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>

    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Pisses me off</td>
        <td>Makes me want to sleep</td>
        <td>Don't even have a class</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Talks too much</td>
        <td>Talks too little and bad posture</td>
